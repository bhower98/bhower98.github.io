	<p>My favorite denomination of coin to collect is the half dollar. I don't have any books or albums for these, but I love the size of them and the designs that are printed on them. I have one Capped Bust Half Dollar that I'm very proud of - the picture shown is NOT my coin, it's just an example. I also love the Walking Liberty design.
